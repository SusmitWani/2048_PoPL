# 2048_PoPL
A playable 2048 game made made on windows device to fulfil the requirement of Principles of Programming Languages (PoPL) course. The code is structural without modules.

I have included windows.h to run a wait command at the end of the game. So you might need to modify the code a little to run it on a linux machine.

The game runs one and then exits. If i get the time adn motivation, I am planning to include the undo and the restart functions in the game.
